Hi Community,

The MAUIsland team is eager to learn new things from you! Your beautiful designs and clean code practices help us build a stronger community. To showcase your best efforts, we have introduced a new feature in MAUIsland called **"Showcases."** This feature provides meaningful previews of your applications to our audience, helping you grow your network. Your applications will be displayed beautifully in selected device frames such as iPhone, Samsung, or Surface devices, and we'll reference your work using GitHub links.

### Requirements for your app on our platform:
1. **Open-source**: Our application cannot access private repositories, which means features like reading the repo title and the project .csproj file are unavailable. Additionally, users won't have further information about your source if it's private.
2. **.NET Technologies Stack**: We currently accept Uno Platform, UWP, WPF, WinUI 2/3, .NET MAUI, and Avalonia. As a .NET community, we aim to keep our showcases relevant to .NET audiences, but we plan to expand our scope later.

We look forward to seeing your amazing work!
