# Version 2.0 (Dragon version)
1. Revamped Design üé®: The application now features a sleek, acrylic material design. The interface is smoother, with enhanced contrast and reduced distractions, offering users a more engaging experience.

2. Performance Enhancements üèéÔ∏è: Significant improvements have been made in page navigation, resulting in a reduced memory footprint. Additionally, internet data is cached locally in a database, enhancing performance and enabling better offline support. The lazy loading of the code view expander contributes to faster initialization of pages.

3. Expanded Community Toolkit üî®: The Community Toolkit Gallery has been enriched with the addition of four new controls, nine converters, and three layouts, empowering developers with more tools to enhance their applications.

4. GitHub Community Gallery ü§ù: We've integrated six widely used GitHub nuggets that are commonly utilized with .NET MAUI, including LiveChart2, ZXing.Net.Maui, and more. This gallery not only provides access to these resources but also offers UI fixes to address issues like stretched clicking and hovering targets for a smoother user interaction.
